# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving a Stochastic New-Keynesian Model** and is centered around running a simple New-Keynesian model using python-code, and interpretting the results.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
